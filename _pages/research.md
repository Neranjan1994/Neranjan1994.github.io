### Some open problems that I am working on.

Currently, I am working on two isoperimetric problems with my advisor. 

- The first problem was a conjecture mentioned in the classical book "Isoperimetric inequalities in Mathematical Physics" written by G. Polya and G. Szego. In this book, they proved following two important results. 

a) Among all the triangles having a fixed area, the equilateral triangle has the largest conformal radius and torsional rigidity. Moreover, it has the smallest perimeter, fundamental frequency and logarithmic capacity. 

b) Among all the quadrilaterals having a fixed area, the square has the largest conformal radius and torsional rigidity. Moreover, it has the smallest perimeter, fundamental frequency and logarithmic capacity. 

The most interesting fact is that Polya and Szego have used the Steiner Symmetrization to prove the results mentioned above. They have selected suitable axes of symmetrization to preserve the number of sides of triangles and quadrilaterals when they apply the Steiner Symmetrization. [This](https://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Steiner/SteinerSlides.pdf) includes the definition and some properties of Steiner Symmetrization. This problem will be challenging when there are more than four sides. The reason is that it is difficult to select axis of symmetrization in a way that the number of sides are invariant. 

Problem: Prove or disprove that among all n-gon (n is greater than 4)  having a fixed area, the regulor n-gon has the largest conformal radius ,torsional rigidity and  it has the smallest perimeter, fundamental frequency and logarithmic capacity. 

My advisor, Dr. Solynin had proved that among all the n-gons, the regular n-gon maximized the conformal radius and minimizes the logarithmic capacity. However, the problem is still open for Torsional Rigidity and Fundamental Frequency.
