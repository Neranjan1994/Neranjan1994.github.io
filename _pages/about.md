I was born in Lincoln, NE. My family moved to Sri Lanka when I was about three years old. I completed my secondary education in Kingswood College, Kandy. I came in at 2<sup>nd</sup> place in the Kandy district and 16<sup>th</sup> in Sri Lanka in the GCE A/L examination which is the entrance examination for Sri Lankan universities. I actively engaged in various extra-curricular activities such as the Astronomical Society and chess.

During my time at my undergraduate institute, I was fortunate enough to be selected to the Electrical and Electronic Engineering specialization program which only accepts the top 5 in the general program. While pursuing my degree I started focusing more on signal processing and machine learning, and this led to choosing my Final Year Research Project in a related field. I was blessed to work with several brilliant supervisors who motivated me on pursuing higher studies.

Currently, I am doing my graduate studies at University of Maryland, College Park at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I also work at the Naval Research Lab as a trainee Electrical Engineer.

I enjoy teaching very much. I volunteered as an intructor in my final year to conduct labaratory classes. Also I have partcipated in several workshops conducted for school childeren in rural areas. I believe that education I recieved had a strong influence on my success and I am passionate on contributing back to the society.   

I love being outdoors and hiking with my friends. In my leisure time, I like to read and play video games.
