### A bit about myself 

I was born in Sri Lanka and I completed my secondary education from Bandarawela Central College. For undergraduate studies, I got selected to the University of Peradeniya which was one of the prestigious Universities in Sri Lanka. At University of Peradeniya, I completed my Bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and graduated in 2019. During my undergraduate time, I was more focused towards Signal Processing and Communication Theory. Because of my interest towards mathematics, I decided to pursue my graduate studies in Pure Mathematics. 

In Fall 2021, I started my graduate studies in Mathematics at Texas Tech University. Currently, I am in the third year of my PhD program. While doing the research as a graduate student, I am working as a Graduate Part Time Instructor at Texas Tech University. As an instructor, I enjoy teaching mathematics for undergraduate students. When I am teaching, I love to use chalkboards :). 



My hobbies are creating YouTube videos in Mathematics, playing badminton and traveling.
