Hello and thank you for stopping by! I'm Neranjan Marasinghe, a Ph.D. student in mathematics at Texas Tech University. I am doing research in Complex Analysis, Symmetrization and Potential Theory under Professor <a href="https://www.math.ttu.edu/~asolynin/#links">Alexander Solynin</a>. 
 
I regularly update my website with information about myself, my ongoing research, insights into teaching, and engaging posts on the fascinating world of mathematics.
